You can notify a user when they visit your website with the browser extension installed or conditionally request usage (eg when a user visits a page or clicks a button). 
- To request usage from a user with the AI Pay browser extension when they visit your website, set the 'requestUsageOnPageLoad' field in the website meta tag to true. [Learn about the meta tag](/getting-started/installation).
```
"requestUsageOnPageLoad":true
```
- Otherwise you can conditionally request usage from the user as seen in the example below.

## Example
import { RequestUsageExample } from "../../examples/requestUsage"

<RequestUsageExample />

```tsx
import { SessionRequestData } from "ai-pay/models"
import { requestAiPayUsage } from "ai-pay/methods"

<button
  className="..."
  onClick={() => {
    const requestData: SessionRequestData = {
      requestType: "START_SESSION",
    }

    requestAiPayUsage(requestData)
  }}
>
  {"Request Usage (Show AI Pay Notification)"}
</button>
```
