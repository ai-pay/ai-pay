## AI Pay
AI Pay is a tool that allows website developers to use AI APIs (Chat GPT, image generation etc.) and easily pass on the cost to the users.

The AI Pay client package abstracts security concerns away from the AI development process, so AI APIs can be called from the front end or the back end. Start developing with AI without worrying about payments, users, a backend or a database.

### How It Works
Users with the AI Pay browser extension are notified when they visit a website using AI Pay. The user has the option to specify a budget and start a session. If the user starts the session the website can use any of the supported AI APIs until the session budget runs out. The session can be stopped at any time by the user and automatically stops when the user exits your website. For more details visit the [AI Pay website](https://www.joinaipay.com).

### How It Benefits Website Developers
- Monetise your website.
  - The website receives a portion of the AI Api usage cost.
  - The website where a user first uses AI Pay becomes their affiliate. The affiliate website earns a 5% commission on a user's future credit purchases. (If a user downloads AI Pay and uses your website first you get 5% of their future credit purchases)
- Implement AI without having to handle users, payments, costs or a backend.
- Less than 10 minute setup.
- Build an AI startup proof of concept within hours not weeks.

### How It Benefits The Users Of Your Website
- Users automatically get USD $5 worth of credits when they sign up. This should last most users a few months. 
- AI Pay enables AI products or features that currently aren't economically viable. These AI products could greatly increase a user's productivity or enjoyment on a website.
- Single point of payment for a user.
- Anonymous payment for AI products.
